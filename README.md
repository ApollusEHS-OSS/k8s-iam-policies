# Kubernetes IAM Policies

This repository contains IAM policies useful for running Kubernetes on AWS.

The contents of this repository is subject to changes at any time based on the
current latest and greatest version of Kubernetes, and my thinking about how
IAM policies should be best implimented for AWS. Therefor please do not
rely on the contents of this repository for your own use, rather review them
and then pull a copy into your own infrastructure as code.


## [ecr](ecr.json)
Allows an instance to authenticate with ECR and pull images.

## [amazon-vpc-cni-k8s](amazon-vpc-cni-k8s.json)

Policy for allowing the L-IPAM daemon in the amazon-vpc-cni-k8s CNI plugin
to attach ENIs and private IPs to instances. Based on the documentation
found [here](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s#requirements).

Security and whatnot is way to important to entrust to me!
Please read and review these policies carefully before you
think about using them.

Oh and if I messed up please open a PR!
